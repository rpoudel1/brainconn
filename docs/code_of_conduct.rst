# Code of Conduct

To best facilitate a welcoming and inclusive environment, participation in our
brainconn project, as well as its online community, should be a respectful and
harassment-free experience for everyone.

We explicitly honor diversity in sex, age, ethnicity, race, religion, nationality,
native language, education, socio-economic status, disability, body size,
sexual orientation, gender identity, or level of programming experience.

## Our Community Standards

Our goal is to promote a welcoming environment that is conducive to both innovation and team-work.
To achieve this end, we expect the following from our contributors:

* Use inclusive language (i.e. sex, gender, race, etc.)
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Have empathy for other community members (i.e. programming experience)

Rested assured, we will not tolerate harassment or other inappropriate behavior in our community.
If you violate the below-listed rules, you will be blocked from further comments/community involvement. No exceptions.

* The inclusion of sexualized language or imagery on any contribution, community correspondence, or post.
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Racist or sexist language
* Personal or political attacks on contributors
* Insulting or derogatory comments on contributed code with the intent to undermine contributions
* Public or private harassment

## Our Responsibilities

The maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards
of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective
action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove,
edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within our online GitHub repository
and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting Adam Kimbler at akimbler@fiu.edu or Katie Bottenhorn at kbottenhorn@fiu.edu.
