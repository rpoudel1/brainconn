# Contributing to brainconn

Welcome to our nascent brainconn repo... we appreciate your contributions to this exciting new tool for applying graph theory using Python.

The following guidelines will streamline the process of getting acclimated to the project. If there is anything we failed to cover, please feel free to let us know by opening an [issue][link_issues].

Are you new to GitHub and it's esoteric ways? First you'll need to set up a free [GitHub][link_github] account and sign in. Here are some [instructions][link_signupinstructions].

Perhaps you are veteran GitHub user and know your stuff? Click the links below to get started:

## Joining the conversation

`brainconn` is an independent fork of `bctpy`, which is itself a Python implementation of the `BCT` MATLAB toolbox.
With all love to [Roan LaPlante](https://github.com/aestrivex) and his excellent tool, there were a number of elements we sought to change. Therefore, we chose to develop our ideas independently from his original project fork.
As with most repositories on GitHub, most communications will be through open [issues][link_issues].
For more informal discussions and details on general project updates, a [gitter chat room][link_gitter] will be the place to go.

As you might imagine, there will be plenty of communication between these two platforms; regardless of which you prefer, we look forward to your contributions.

When crafting your contributions to `brainconn`, please be mindful of our [code of conduct][link_coc].

### Issue labels

The current list of labels are [here][link_labels] and include:

* [![Help Wanted](https://img.shields.io/badge/-help%20wanted-159818.svg)][link_helpwanted] *Tasks our members have identified as perfect for new contributors.*

    If you can defeat any of these, we encourage you to slay the issue!

* [![Bugs](https://img.shields.io/badge/-bugs-fc2929.svg)][link_bugs] *These issues point to problems in the project.*

    If you happen upon an unknown bug, please provide as much information as possible in your issue, including all steps necessary to recreate the error.
    If you encounter one of our known bugs in the wild, please provide a comment to document any fresh observations.

* [![Enhancement](https://img.shields.io/badge/-enhancement-84b6eb.svg)][link_enhancement] *Requests for specific enhancements to be added to the project.*

    Please try to make sure your enhancement is unique and not already requested or implemented. If you find a similar request with minor alterations, please reference that request in your issue.


## Making a change

Rest assured that while we appreciate all contributions to brainconn, for simplicity's sake, we prefer the following workflow:

**1. Comment on the present issue or create a new issue explaining your addition.**

We're all about communication... and adherence to this guideline will help the development team ensure your efforts and those of other members are not redundant. Further, it will ensure your proposed contribution is in harmony with other elements of the project.

[This blog][link_pushpullblog] provides an explanation of why an ounch of communication is worth a day of frustrated programming.

**2. [Fork][link_fork] the [brainconn repository][link_brainconn] to your GitHub profile.**

This is your own personal brainconn playground. Any changes in here are isolated, so it's the perfect place to experiment and explore the code.

Make it a habit to [keep your fork up to date][link_updateupstreamwiki] with the master repository. You don't want to make your important changes to an outdated version of the code.

**3. Follow through and make the changes.**

As programmers, we're definitely familiar with the temptation to fix everything at once. Despite this urge, do your best to keep your changes focused.
A good tip: work on a [new branch][link_branches] to keep your current changes targeted.

Please make sure to review the brainconn [style conventions][link_styleguide] when creating your pull request.

**4. Submit your [pull request][link_pullrequest].**

You've done your part, and now a member of the development team will review your changes to confirm they can be merged into the main codebase.


## Recognizing contributions

We welcome and recognize all contributions... from documentation to testing to code development.
You can see a list of current contributors in the [contributors tab][link_contributors].

## Thank you!
